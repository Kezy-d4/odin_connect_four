learning objectives of this project were to practice with RSpec, testing, and
Test-Driven Development.

# Reflections
This project revealed to me the benefits of testing in remaining confident in the code as 
development progresses, allowing for easy extension and refactoring. That said, I barely discovered
a nasty bug during play testing that slipped through my tests. I suppose then that tests can't 
always protect you from what you don't anticipate could go wrong or oversights in the design and 
code.
